```python

def find_polynomial_roots(polynomial):
    roots = []
    # Apply Durand-Kerner method to find roots of the polynomial
    num_coefficients = len(polynomial.coefficients)
    for i in range(num_coefficients - 1):
        x = ComplexNumber(1, 1)  # initial guess for the root
        new_x = ComplexNumber(0, 0)
        while True:
            for j in range(num_coefficients - 1):
                if j != i:
                    new_x += (x - roots[j]) / (x - roots[j]).conjugate()
            new_x /= num_coefficients - 1
            new_x = new_x * (1 - 0.1j) + x * 0.1j  # update the guess using a small step
            if (new_x - x).modulus() < 1e-6:  # check if the guess has converged
                break
            x = new_x
        roots.append(x)
    return roots
```
This implementation uses the Durand-Kerner method to find the roots of the polynomial. It iteratively updates the guess for each root until it converges within a certain tolerance. The roots are stored as ComplexNumber objects and returned in a list.

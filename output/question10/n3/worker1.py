```python
def find_polynomial_roots(polynomial):
    # Initialize empty list to store roots
    roots = []
    
    # Get the coefficients of the polynomial
    coefficients = polynomial.coefficients
    
    # Use a numerical method, such as Durand-Kerner method, to find the roots
    # ...

    # Return the roots
    return roots
```
Note: The implementation of the numerical method for finding the roots of a polynomial is not provided in the given code. You would need to find and implement a suitable numerical method, such as the Durand-Kerner method, to populate the `roots` list.

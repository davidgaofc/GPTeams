            if guess.modulus() < 0.000001:

This implementation uses the Durand-Kerner method to find the roots of the polynomial. It starts with initial guesses for the roots and iteratively updates the guesses until they converge. The guesses are updated using the formula:

    guess -= numerator / denominator

where the numerator is the value of the polynomial at the current guess, and the denominator is the product of the differences between the current guess and all the other roots. The process continues until the modulus of the guess is close to zero, indicating convergence.

Note: The implementation assumes that the ComplexNumber and Polynomial classes are defined correctly.

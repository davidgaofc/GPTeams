Here is the combined function:

```
def find_polynomial_roots(polynomial):
    roots = []
    n = len(polynomial.coefficients) - 1

    # Iterate through all possible complex numbers to find the roots
    for i in range(n):
        x = ComplexNumber(0, 0)
        while True:
            # Use the Durand-Kerner method to approximate the roots
            f = polynomial.evaluate(x)
            if abs(f) < 0.0001:
                roots.append(x)
                break
            
            # Update x using the formula
            x = x - polynomial.evaluate(x) / polynomial.derivative().evaluate(x)
    
    # Use scipy's fsolve function with initial guesses from numpy's roots function
    def f(x):
        return polynomial.evaluate(x)
    
    initial_guesses = np.roots(polynomial.coefficients)
    scipy_roots = opt.fsolve(f, initial_guesses)
    
    # Convert the roots to ComplexNumber objects
    combined_roots = [ComplexNumber(root, 0) for root in roots] + [ComplexNumber(root, 0) for root in scipy_roots]
    
    return combined_roots
```

This combined function takes the best parts of both solutions. It first uses the Durand-Kerner method to approximate the roots, similar to the first solution. Then, it uses scipy's `fsolve` function with initial guesses obtained from numpy's `roots` function, as in the second solution. The roots are converted to `ComplexNumber` objects and returned as a list.

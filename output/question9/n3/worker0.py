```python
def optimize_vehicle_loading(warehouse, vehicle):
    # Sort products in the warehouse by decreasing value-to-weight ratio
    products = sorted(warehouse.inventory.values(), key=lambda x: x['product'].value / x['product'].weight, reverse=True)
    
    loaded_products = []
    remaining_capacity = vehicle.capacity
    
    # Iterate over the sorted products and add them to the vehicle if there is enough capacity
    for product in products:
        if product['quantity'] > 0 and product['product'].weight <= remaining_capacity:
            quantity_loaded = min(product['quantity'], remaining_capacity // product['product'].weight)
            loaded_products.append((product['product'], quantity_loaded))
            remaining_capacity -= quantity_loaded * product['product'].weight
            product['quantity'] -= quantity_loaded
    
    return loaded_products
```

This implementation uses a greedy approach to solve the problem. It sorts the products in the warehouse by the value-to-weight ratio in descending order. Then, it iterates over the sorted products and adds them to the vehicle as long as there is enough capacity. It keeps track of the remaining capacity of the vehicle and reduces the quantity of the product in the warehouse accordingly. Finally, it returns the list of loaded products.

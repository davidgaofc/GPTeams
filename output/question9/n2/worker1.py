```python
def optimize_vehicle_loading(warehouse, vehicle):
    # Get a list of all products in the warehouse
    products = warehouse.inventory.keys()
    
    # Sort the products by their value-to-weight ratio in descending order
    sorted_products = sorted(products, key=lambda p: p.value / p.weight, reverse=True)
    
    loaded_products = []
    
    # Iterate through the sorted products and try to add them to the vehicle
    for product in sorted_products:
        quantity = warehouse.get_product_quantity(product)
        
        if vehicle.add_product(product, quantity):
            loaded_products.append((product, quantity))
        
    return loaded_products
```
Note: This solution uses a greedy approach, where we prioritize adding products with a higher value-to-weight ratio. However, this may not always result in the optimal solution. For certain cases, where the values and weights of the products are not proportional, a dynamic programming solution may be more appropriate to find the optimal solution.

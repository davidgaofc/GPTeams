```python
def optimize_vehicle_loading(warehouse, vehicle):
    # Get the inventory from the warehouse
    inventory = warehouse.inventory
    # Sort the inventory by the value of the products
    sorted_inventory = sorted(inventory.items(), key=lambda x: x[1]['product'].value, reverse=True)
    # Initialize variables
    loaded_products = []
    remaining_capacity = vehicle.max_capacity
    # Iterate through the sorted inventory
    for item in sorted_inventory:
        product = item[1]['product']
        quantity = min(item[1]['quantity'], remaining_capacity // product.weight)
        if quantity > 0:
            # Add the product to the vehicle's load
            loaded_products.append((product, quantity))
            # Update the remaining capacity and inventory quantity
            remaining_capacity -= quantity * product.weight
            inventory[item[0]]['quantity'] -= quantity
        if remaining_capacity == 0:
            # If the vehicle is fully loaded, break the loop
            break
    return loaded_products
```

This implementation of the `optimize_vehicle_loading` function sorts the inventory of the warehouse by the value of the products in descending order. It then iterates through the sorted inventory and adds products to the vehicle's load as long as the weight capacity allows. The function returns a list of tuples, each containing a Product object and the quantity loaded on the vehicle.

Note that this implementation uses a greedy approach, which may not always provide the optimal solution to the knapsack problem. Depending on the specific requirements and constraints of the problem, a different approach, such as dynamic programming, may be needed for an optimal solution.

The above code implements the `find_articulation_points` function using a modified depth-first search (DFS) algorithm based on Tarjan's algorithm. The function first initializes empty dictionaries to store the discovery time and low link of vertices. It also initializes a variable `time` to keep track of the current time during the traversal.

The DFS traversal is performed using a nested function `dfs`. In this function, the discovery time and low link of the current vertex are stored and updated accordingly. The number of children of the current vertex is also tracked. The function then iterates over all neighboring vertices of the current vertex.

If a neighboring vertex is not visited, the function recursively calls `dfs` on that vertex and updates the low link of the current vertex based on the low link of the neighbor. It also checks for articulation points based on the conditions specified in the problem description.

If a neighboring vertex is already visited and not the parent of the current vertex, the function updates the low link of the current vertex based on the discovery time of the neighbor.

After the DFS traversal is performed on all vertices, the function returns the list of articulation points.

Note: The code assumes that the `add_vertex`, `add_edge`, and `get_vertices` methods are implemented in the `Graph` class.
